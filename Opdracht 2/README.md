# WEB-DESIGN

## ASSIGNMENT 2 

For this assigment I had to design a website with real users in mind. So I decided to design and build my own portfolio website. 

### USER SCENARIO

#### USER 1: Marie.
Marie is deaf, this means she has quite some hurdles with spoken and written language. This is why I've put the emphasis on a clear graphical hiearchie, intuïtive user flow and as little text as needed.

#### USER SCENARIO:
Marie is visiting my portfolio website and wants to see wat kind of projects I've done.

#### USER 2: 
Erik Felderhof, Employer.

#### USER SCENARIO:
Erik is looking to hire a new web developer, he hopes my portfolio could give him some insight in wether i'd be a suitable candidate.

### DESIGN PRINCIPLE 

#### PRINCIPLE #1: Clarity is job #1
My goal for this project was to create a visually aesthetic interface supported by features (e.g. micro animations) that enhance the user flow in an intuïtive manner. This of course is mainly with Marie in mind, who is blind and is mainly focussed on the visual spectrum.

#### PRINCIPLE #11: Strong visual hiearchies works best 
The website has a clear vertical flow thanks to the 

#### PRINCIPLE #14: Progressive Disclosure
To create a minimalistic design I implemented this principle by hiding the meta data and full size views of certain main elements, this also enhances the clarity and the visual hiearchy. 

### ITERATIONS

#### Moving stars in hero image
To heavy to little effect, so removed it.
=> Changed it to a constantly changing gradient.

#### Header on gallery images where aligned to the bottom
Problem is that the animation - when opening an image - was to cluttered and had to much movement.
=> Solved it by aligning the header to the top. The content slides in from the bottom

#### Arrows on gallery images to show detail content
Tests showed it wasn't clear if the button was to open another section (detail) or to close the gallery image itself.
=> Used a 'information' icon in the right top corner to prevent confusion.

#### I wanted to give some affordances to the user when opening the detail part of an image
There's no clear indication what's about to happen when pushing this button
=> Solved it by sliding in the content partially - only 5% of the height - just enough to see the title and to know what to expect (the detail part is going to slide up when I push this button)

#### Arrows on gallery images to show detail content
Tests showed it wasn't clear if the button was to open another section (detail) or to close the gallery image itself.
=> Used a 'information' icon in the right top corner to prevent confusion.
