# WEB-DESIGN

## ASSIGNMENT 2 

For this assigment I had to design a website with real users in mind. So I decided to design and build my own portfolio website. 

### USER SCENARIO

USER 1: Marie.
Marie is deaf, this means she has quite some hurdles with spoken and written language. This is why I've put the emphasis on a clear graphical hiearchie, intu√Øtive user flow and as little text as needed.

USER SCENARIO:
Marie is visiting my portfolio website and wants to see wat kind of projects I've done.

USER 2: 
Erik Felderhof, Employer.

USER SCENARIO:
Erik is looking to hire a new web developer, he hopes my portfolio could give him some insight in wether i'd be a suitable candidate.
